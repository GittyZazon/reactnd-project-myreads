# MyReads Project

This is a project given by Udacity as part of the React ND and Google Dev ND Scholarship Front-End track.

## What it Does:

This app contains two sections - the home page with the user's shelves and the search page where the user can access "unshelved" books of their choosing. Each book displayed has a drop down menu that allows the user to change which "shelf" the book is on.

## To Get Started:

In order to access this app, one can use git clone or download the files to their computer by simply clicking on the green button on the repository page that says "Clone or download" and following the instructions.
In order to get the app running properly, once cloned or downloaded, use npm install and then npm start in your terminal once navigated to the project folder in the terminal.

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
